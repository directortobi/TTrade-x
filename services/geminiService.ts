        **Market Data:**
        *   1-Minute Chart (Last 100 Candles): Latest Price: ${data1m[data1m.length - 1].close}
        *   15-Minute Chart (Last 100 Candles): Latest Price: ${data15m[data15m.length - 1].close}

        ${userNotesPrompt}
        **Analysis Instructions:**
        1.  **Technical Indicator Analysis:** Based on the provided candlestick data, infer the state of and signals from the following technical indicators:
            *   **RSI (Relative Strength Index):** Is the asset overbought, oversold, or showing divergence? Determine its numerical value and interpretation.
            *   **MACD (Moving Average Convergence Divergence):** Is there a bullish or bearish crossover? What is the histogram momentum? Determine the signal.
            *   **Bollinger Bands:** Is the price trading near the upper or lower band? Is there a "squeeze" indicating potential volatility?
            *   **Candlestick Pattern Analysis:** Scrutinize the chart for significant candlestick patterns such as Doji, Engulfing patterns (Bullish/Bearish), Hammer, Shooting Star, or Morning/Evening Star formations, especially near key support and resistance levels. These patterns are crucial for confirming potential reversals or continuations.
            *   **Market Structure:** Identify the current trend and look for any 'break of structure' (BoS) that might signal a trend reversal or continuation. Determine the overall trend direction ('Bullish', 'Bearish', 'Sideways').
        2.  **Multi-Timeframe Confirmation:** Correlate findings from the technical indicators across the 1m, 15m, and 1h charts to establish a confluence of signals.
        3.  **Support and Resistance:** Identify the most significant and nearest support and resistance price levels from the 15m and 1h charts.
        4.  **Sentiment Integration:** How does the news sentiment support or contradict the technical analysis?
        5.  **Decision and Levels:** Decide on a BUY, SELL, or HOLD signal. If BUY or SELL, provide a precise Entry Price, Take Profit, and Stop Loss. If HOLD, set price levels to 0.
        6.  **Rationale:** Provide a clear, concise explanation for your decision. **Crucially, your rationale must begin by stating any identified candlestick patterns and their implications.** Then, integrate this with your analysis of technical indicators (RSI, MACD, Bollinger Bands) and market structure to build a cohesive argument for the trade.
        7.  **Confidence & Risk:**
            *   Provide a 'confidenceLevel' (0-100) for this signal.
            *   Calculate the 'takeProfit' and 'stopLoss' distance in pips. For most pairs, 1 pip = 0.0001. For JPY pairs (e.g., USD/JPY), 1 pip = 0.01.
            *   Calculate the 'riskRewardRatio' (Take Profit pips / Stop Loss pips). Format it as a string "1:X".
            *   The 'pair' is ${pair}.

              *   **Analyze Market Structure:** Identify the trend, key horizontal and trend-line support/resistance levels, and any **'break of structure' (BoS)**. Determine the most significant support and resistance levels and the overall trend direction.
              *   **Identify Candlestick Patterns:** This is a critical step. Search for powerful candlestick patterns like Doji, Engulfing, Hammer, or Shooting Star. Note where they appear (e.g., at a resistance level) as this heavily influences their meaning.
          3.  **Synthesize Findings:** Combine the analysis of price action, market structure, and all visible indicators to form a cohesive view.
          4.  **Decision and Levels:**
              *   Decide on a **BUY, SELL, or HOLD** signal.
              *   If BUY or SELL, provide a precise **Entry Price**, **Take Profit**, and **Stop Loss** based on your analysis. Entry should be near the last visible price.
              *   If HOLD, set price levels to 0.
          5.  **Rationale:** Provide a step-by-step explanation. **Start by describing any candlestick patterns you found and what they signal in the current context.** Then, connect this to your analysis of market structure and other visible indicators to justify your signal.
          6.  **Confidence & Risk:**
              *   Provide a 'confidenceLevel' (0-100) for the signal.
              *   Calculate 'takeProfit' and 'stopLoss' distance in **pips**. Use standard definitions (0.0001 for 4-decimal prices, 0.01 for 2-decimal prices).
